It will provide url that can be sent to target and when target visit it it will be hook to over beef framework and beef panel url will also be provided by tool to access and perform attacks on hooked browser.</p>
        <h4>2. Hooking Victums outside the network using Port Forwording: </h4>
        <p>It will create web page having capabilities to hook browser to beef framework which could be used within the network and also against the target that are outside the network (not connected to same network). But you need to configure your router to forword ports in order to make it work. It will provide url that can be sent to target and when target visit it it will be hook to over beef framework and beef panel url will also be provided by tool to access and perform attacks on hooked browser.</p>
        <h4>3. Hooked Victums outside the network using Localhost.run: </h4>
        <p>It will create web page having capabilities to hook browser to beef framework which could be used within and outside the network. Localhost.run is free service to expose your Localhost to internet using ssh tunneling. Tool will setup ssh key and then using it will create public urls of both the webserver and beef panel using Localhost.run service. It will provide url that can be sent to target and when target visit it it will be hook to over beef framework and beef panel url will also be provided by tool to access and perform attacks on hooked browser.</p>
        <h4>4. Hooking Victums outside the network using ngrok: </h4>
        <p>It will create web page having capabilities to hook browser to beef framework which could be used within and outside the network. Ngrok is one of the famous service to expose your Localhost to internet. Free ngrok token is not recommended for web page as it warns the target before going to page which will reduce the success of attack. For ngrok, you will need first to signup to ngrok website and will need ngrok auth-token to provide to this tool in order for this attack to work.</p>
        <h4>5. Hooking Victums outside the network using serveo: </h4>
        <p>It will create web page having capabilities to hook browser to beef framework which could be used within and outside the network. Serveo is free service to expose your Localhost to internet using ssh tunneling. It is similar to Localhost.run. Tool will setup ssh key and then using it will create public url using serveo service. It will provide url that can be sent to target and when target visit it it will be hook to over beef framework and beef panel url will also be provided by tool to access and perform attacks on hooked browser.</p>
        <h4>6. Web Page Options: </h4>
        <p>Phishing Page creation menu is used to create phishing page. It includes 3 different method to setup the phishing page.</p>
